They plan on pursuing the goals of Vision Zero, an organization with a strategy to eliminate all traffic fatalities and severe injuries, while increasing safe, healthy, equitable mobility for all. Our project involves the examination of crash data sourced from the City of Chicago's Data Portal to further this mission. By analyzing this data, we hope to create a predictive model that can help evaluate trends across crashes. Through this comprehensive analysis, we will be able to make recommendations for Chicago to make their streets safer."

    "We recommend Chicago look to the Strong Towns organization and what they have accomplished in restructuring the development of cities to be more suitable and safer for citizens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first recommendation is to redesign your crosswalks. Raising the Crosswalks increases its visibility and makes it clear to both driver and pedestrian that this area of the street is designed for the pedestrian's safety first by forcing the driver to slow down as they approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://github.com/nickthetj/DSC-Phase3-Project/assets/126971652/7f05dd49-1770-48a6-8b30-e2e964a71a86)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Second recommendation is to narrow the size of the street by introducing bike lanes. Many city streets have low speed limits but are wide by design so that drivers feel comfortable speeding. By tightening the space around them and introducing bake lanes with barriers to separate them from the the car lanes, drivers will be more attentive to their surroundings and more inclined to slow down.\n",
    "![image](https://github.com/nickthetj/DSC-Phase3-Project/assets/126971652/2ae7b332-5d82-42c8-8aff-b9999b83ae10)\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, our model with .71 recall score shows two main ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "One, that Pedestrians and Cyclists are most at risk for fatalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "And two, that fatal crashes are likely to be caused by drivers not following the rules of the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe Chicago can move closer to zero fatalities by implementing raised crosswalks and narrower streets via protected bike lanes."

    "1. Crash Location Investigation\n",
    "2. BAC Investigation\n",
    "   \n",
    "For the crash location investigation, the datasets we worked with provided some information available on the location of every crash, but it was broken down by street. It might be easier and more efficient to break the city down into areas or districts to highlight particular problem areas of the city that could be reformed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the BAC investigation, the top preliminary cause and fatal percentage of fatal crashes was the Physical Condition of the Driver. With more time we could investigate how much of this was due to drunk drivers or drivers under the influence of drugs."
